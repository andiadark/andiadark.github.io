							<h2>Project 1: <br /> Test Automation</h2>
							<p>
								<h3> Project Description:</h3>
								Given an executable program, creat a test automation file that checks for the correct expected results,
								and create a test report file the holds the results of the test along with the inputs of the test.<br />
								<br />
								<h3>File for Test Automation:   <br />   <a href="test_roots.csh">Roots CSH File</a></h3> 
								<h3>Roots Test Results: <br />
								<a href="utr_roots.txt">Roots UTR File</a> </h3>
								<h3>Test Summary: <br /> <a href="testSummary_adark_roots.txt">Roots Test Summary</a><br /></h3>
								<h3>Reflections:</h3>
								The goal of this assignment was to gain experience writing a test automation
								for the roots.crun program.<br />
								The specifications were established by running the code supplied to me and taking
								note on how the program is working.Then the testcases were created after getting a good understanding of the program leads to
								better quaility test cases.Repeatability is established in the test automation itself. The test automation allows for
								multiple programs to be tested with the test cases that have been created in this assignment.
								The test automation creates a utr file wich allows for accountability. The utr is a test report
								file which gives the results of the testing performed on the program.Having everything in one place,
								a place to run the test cases, and a way to look at the results of the test.

							<h2>Project 2:<br /> TestLab2: Blackbox Testing</h2>
							<p>
								<h3>Description</h3>
								The purpose of this assignment was to use a decision table to help guide the creation of test cases.
								The decision table was used to create functional test cases as well as boundary test case.
								<br /><br />
								<h3>Decision Table:<br />  <a href="dtb_adark_tablefile.txt"> Blackbox Decision Table</a><br /></h3>
								<h3>Test Cases:<br /><a href="tci_adark-ftc.txt">Functional Test Cases</a><br />
								<a href="tci_adark-bbtc.txt">Boundary Test Cases</a><br /></h3>
								<h3>Reflections:</h3>This assignemnt help me to get an understanding of how to create a decision table.This assignment also help me to figure out how to 
								use a decision table to create funcitonal test cases, and boundary test cases.<br />
								This assignment focused on the specification, premeditaion and repeatability aspects of the SPRAE framework.
								Based on the specification of your project you can create a table that will help you establish the different criterias you need
								to meet when creating your test cases.The decision tables are valuable once you have gathered a good understand of the goals for the program
								you are testing.After a decision table is created it can be used over and over to help guide test case creation.

							<h2>Final Project</h2>
							<p>
								<h3> Project Description:</h3>
								The goal of this project was to generate a grader that can be used to grade a programming assignment.<br />
								<!--<h3>Techniques</h3>-->
								<br /><h3>Utility Billing CSH File:<br />
								<a href="gradeMy_utility_Billing.csh">gradeMy CSH</a></h3>

								<a href="My_utility_Billing.cpp_testreport-popeye.txt">Popeye Test Report</a><br /></h3>
								<h3>Reflections:</h3>This assignment related to the SPRAE framework in many ways.
								Having csh files ready for users to generate test cases, generate an automated grader,
								and to create the test reports for the sample programs.
								In this project I used the specification aspect of the framework in two ways. I used the directions given to take the necessary steps
								to complete the automatic grading, and I also had to use the specifications for the utility_billing program to create relevant test cases.
								Premeditation was also utilized when creating the test cases.
								Having each step automated relates to the Repeatability aspect of the framework. Allowing users to use
								the same programs over and over for many different programs is very useful.
								This assignments economic advatage is that it would easily allow for many programs to be tested with one grader and the test cases generated can be used
								for more than just one program is necessary.
								<br />
								Overall in this assignemnt I feel as though I got a good understand of how to use an automated
								generator to test programs based of different specifications set by the specifications.
								I was able to use skills i have learned in this course to create valuable test cases that will
								allow for adequate testing of students programs. Based on specifications given in the directions for
								the utility_Billing program I made sure to test the different paths the program takes to get to the results.
								This assignment used everything we have done this semester and put it to the test. Using different unix commands
								I was able to easily test indivdual programs to generate test reports for the sample programs.
