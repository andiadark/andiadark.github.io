ACTIONS:

   1) Construct decision table for program. Discuss with one classmate to
      verify correctness.

   2) Develop functional test cases based on rules(columns) in decision table.
      2.1  Store these test cases in tci_xxxx-ftc.txt.
      2.2  Discuss your test cases with one classmate.

   3) Develop boundary test cases based on the conditions in the decision table.
      3.1  Store these test cases in tci_xxxx-bbtc.txt.
      3.2  Discuss your test cases with one classmate.

   4) Begin working on the test_xxxx.csh automation. I will provide demo versions of
      each program so you can see what the outputs LOOK LIKE.

   5) I will give you versions of your program to test in class on Tuesday -- I want
      to see your "reaction" to the quality of your test cases.

      This time consider adding arguments to your test script, such as:

          (1) tester
          (2) run_filename
          (3) tdi_filename
          (4) utr_filename

      These changes will enable you to use the SAME script to test DIFFERENT VERSIONS
      of the program under test, which you will do in the next assignment.

      Feel free to exchange ideas about these matters. 

      NOTE: We are still using C-SHELL scripts.
